# GAN in Numpy
This is a very simple step by step implementation of GAN using only numpy.  
Without the use of GPU, it takes too much time to generate all the numbers.  
To get the result quickly using only CPU, I suggest working with one number.  

### What you can find
* Vanilla GAN
* Xavier Initialization
* SGD

### Requirements  
* Numpy  
* Opencv/PIL (to visualize/save results)  
* cupy (optional, to leverage gpu for matrix computations)
